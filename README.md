# Online-Payment-Fraud-Detection

# Project Overview

This project aims to detect fraudulent online payment transactions using machine learning techniques. It leverages historical transaction data to identify patterns indicative of fraud, helping financial institutions mitigate risks and protect users from fraudulent activities.


# Features

- Data Preprocessing:  Cleansing and transforming raw transaction data.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying fraud patterns using statistical and visualization techniques.

- Feature Engineering: Creating meaningful features for better fraud detection.

- Model Training: Implementing machine learning algorithms for classification.

- Evaluation & Optimization: Assessing model performance and tuning hyperparameters.

- Deployment: Deploying the fraud detection model via API or a dashboard.

# Technologies Used

- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn, Flask/FastAPI for deployment)

- Jupyter Notebook for data exploration and model training

- Power BI/Tableau for visualization (optional)

- MySQL/PostgreSQL for storing transaction data
